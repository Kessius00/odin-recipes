# odin-recipes
a basic recipe website

In this project I have demonstrated I can:
- Use both relative and absolute links
- Implement images in a webpage
- Make a list
- use emphasis in italic and bold with a strong tag!

I like the linking a bit, but the thing I liked the most was learn a bit more about Git and Github. It just seems to fascinate me how it works
